The synthesis, production, and dissemination of new knowledge can have broad implications for every area of human endeavor, and art provides an entryway to new understandings of that human endeavor for both artist and audience. In this course, we explore and apply the research process in the creation of fine art. Through careful study of a selected genre or discipline and rigorous interrogation of a subject or set of subjects, we explore the intersections between fact and invention, the difficulty of separating the objective from the subjective, and the ethical implications of using research to inform the creation of art. The culmination of the course is student-created works of art informed by the research process. The area of the fine arts on which the course focuses varies year to year and encompass the range of the fine arts \u2013 from creative writing to the visual arts, music, and drama. The focus is announced with the published course offerings each year."

In this course, the second in a required two-course sequence, students take an interdisciplinary, cultural-studies approach to the critical study of American history and literature\u2014from the period of Reconstruction to the present day.\u00a0Students examine the continuing development of both collective and individual American identities through the study of history and historiography, literature and literary theory, politics, economics, law, material culture, the visual arts, film, music, and other aspects of American culture. A key feature of the curriculum is instruction and practice in close and critical reading, critical thinking, and academic writing\u2014skills foundational to NCSSM's senior humanities courses and to future higher-level work across disciplines. Discussions, group and individual projects, and a variety of writing assignments invite students to recover, construct, interrogate, and interpret the past as narratives woven from many threads. Through collaborative inquiry and investigation, students encounter the past as a means of interrogating issues in our current world and as a path to becoming informed, empathetic, engaged, and ethical citizens in their local and global communities."

This can be done by improving seeds and through better management of farms-- through technological innovation. Agricultural biotechnology is thriving globally, especially in the Research Triangle here in NC as new agriculture companies set up shop to employ and collaborate with our region's' academic talent. In this course, students will examine how farms around the world are intensifying agriculture and promoting sustainability through plant breeding, transgenic plant and animal development, and soon, gene editing. They will learn about and build automated smart devices like weather stations, sensor motes, robots and drones using the Arduino platform. They will analyze agricultural data to help farmers make better decisions. And finally they will propose and prototype solutions that improve the practices of subsistence farmers and large scale growers around the world. This course meets North Carolina standards for Agriscience and Biotechnology IV: Agricultural Solutions."

In this introduction to the composition and reading of creative writing\u2014poetry, fiction, drama, and creative non-fiction\u2014students can build a solid foundation for the craft of creative writing. Participants will stretch themselves creatively through experimenting with form and modeling the work of great writers across genres, times, and traditions. The guiding principle of the course is that creative writing is a means of engaging with the world, whether that means writing a personal essay, a food memoir, or a sonnet. In addition to one synchronous class each week, students will work individually on asynchronous assignments and collaborate with peers in workshops where burgeoning writers encounter an affirming and constructive audience for their work. Assignments focus on developing the tools for writing in many genres and styles, along with developing the habits to enable the generation of ideas, the creation of voice, the construction of narrative and image, and the process of revision. Throughout the term, students accumulate a group of works written in and out of class for inclusion in a portfolio that is the foundation of students\u2019 assessment in the course. By the end of this course, students will have both a polished portfolio of their best work and the skills to deeply engage in a creative process that results in powerful writing."

Drawing from the fields of archaeology, history, literature, and cultural studies, students trace the development of early China, Japan, and Korea. Students examine texts from early religious and literary traditions, including Buddhism, Confucianism, Daoism, and Shinto. Texts may include Buddhist sutras, Confucius' Analects, Laozi's Dao de Jing, T'ang poetry, Lady Shonagon's Pillow Book, Luo Guanzhong\u2019s Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Lady Murasaki Shikibu's Tale of Genji, and the Tale of the Heike. The class consists of a creative mix of lectures, discussions, and verbal and written analyses of moving and still images. Students continue to develop their writing skills by writing academic and interpretive essays on interdisciplinary topics as well as creative works that emulate East Asian genres. Students also collaborate on projects in which they produce their own artwork (such as digital and terrestrial gardens, curated museum exhibits, and revisions and additions to literary masterpieces) to demonstrate their understanding of East Asian cultures and accomplishments."

Primary texts include Zen parables, Kenko's \u201cEssays in Idleness,\u201d Basho's poetry, Journey to the West, Dream of the Red Chamber, and Outlaws of the Marsh. The second part of the course presents a radically changed and dynamic landscape. We explore the upheavals of the early twentieth century, including the world wars and revolutionary restructuring of East Asian politics and societies. We explore the significance of modernism and postmodernism in contemporary Asian cultural expressions with an emphasis on the cartoon visions found in manga and anime. Texts may include Kawabata's Snow Country or Tanizaki's Naomi, manga and anime, writings of Mao Zedong, CCP propaganda posters, Ai Wei Wei's art, kung fu and samurai film clips, and Zhang Yimou\u2019s To Live. The class consists of a creative mix of lectures, discussions, and verbal and written analyses of moving and still images.

Readings may include excerpts from Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War, Sima Qian's Records of the Historian, Sun Tzu's Art of War, Confucius' Analects, Laozi's Dao de Jing, memorials by Han Feizi and Li Si, the Bible, Buddhist sutras, Homer's Iliad, Luo Guanzhong's Three Kingdoms, St. Augustine's City of God, collected writings of the Church fathers, Castiglione's Book of the Courtier, Sei Shonagon's Pillow Book, and Murasaki Shikibu's Tale of Genji. Secondary texts and film clips will also be used to interpret these ancient and classical works. Students reflect on the intellectual frameworks and ethical foundations of East Asia and the West and analyze the evolution and manifestations of these ideas and values in cultural products, institutions, rituals, and ceremonies. In pursuit of these goals, students write at least one academic essay and undertake multiple group projects. These collective experiences encourage students to imagine history into being through manipulation, integration, and creation of products representative of the various intersections and divergences encountered on our journey across Eurasia."

We examine indigenous civilizations\u2014including those of the Mayans, Aztecs, and Incas\u2014along with the Renaissance backgrounds of the European conquests and the flowering of a new economy of imagination for both Europeans and natives. We investigate the complex world view that produced innovations in cartography and navigation in Europe, as well as the religious and social motivations of Iberian explorers and how their attitudes differed from their English and French counterparts. We look at the blended culture of the Caribbean and at the nature of slave culture in Brazil and the Caribbean, along with constructions of color and understandings of race that differ markedly from those in North America. Literary works include selections from the Mayan Popol Vuh, the chronicles of European explorers like Christopher Columbus and Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo, and writings by Catalina de Erauso and Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz."

Students examine topics such as the devastating effects of the Cold War/Proxy wars in Latin America, the development of different cultures throughout the region, environmental concerns and crises affecting the resources and environment of Central and South America, the influx of Hispanic immigrants into North America, the development of Latino identity, the impact of the drug wars on all parts of the Americas, and new roles for Latin Americans in the twenty-first century. Texts for this course include modern periodicals and media, current analyses of the political, economic and cultural events of Latin America, as well as reports and materials on Hispanic and Latino life and culture in North America. Students participate in a research project/presentation investigating a current issue in Latin American life and culture."

Writers of the Latin American \u201cBoom\u201d of the 1960s and 70s such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Julio Cortazar will be studied alongside authors such as Uruguayan short story writer Horacio Quiroga, Argentinian purveyor of enigmatic fictions Jorge Luis Borges, and protean Brazilian writer Clarice Lispector, whose short fiction and novels are at the moment finding a large audience in North America. In Latin America, literature and politics are hardly strangers; we will particularly examine the influence and representations of one political event\u2014the Chilean coup d\u2019etat in 1973, which was experienced firsthand by Ariel Dorfman and Roberto Bola\u00f1o, writers whose accounts of the event we will compare. Students will read, research, and write about contemporary authors such as Valeria Luiselli and C\u00e9sar Aira, and we will debate the usefulness of terms associated with Modern Latin American literature (e.g. \u201cmagical realism\u201d). Much of the literature we read in this class is highly original and experimental, sometimes wildly so. Developing the skills and confidence required to read, think about, discuss, and make sense of complex and rich texts are central concerns of this class."

        "description": "This course begins with the idea of the individual as it emerges in the literature, philosophy religion, and art of Ancient Greece, Rome, and Late Antiquity. It continues with ideas about identity in medieval Christendom, and traces the emergence of national literatures, new forms of architecture, and the first nation-states in the High Middle Ages and early Renaissance. It ends with Dante\u2019s Inferno and with Petrarch, the poet whose preoccupation with his own celebrity points the way to the humanism of the Renaissance and the concept of self-fashioning that is the hallmark of modernity. We see the Greeks invent history as an entity distinct from both myth and chronicle, and learn how ideas about history evolve along with ideas about the self, that mysterious and vexing entity that is still our preoccupation today. Throughout the term, we read forward and backward in the Western tradition, exploring both contemporary and historical debates about the nature of history, personal identity, and the uses of literature and art, not only in ancient and medieval writers, but in modern thinkers from Marx to Nietzsche, Adorno, Althusser, and Deleuze. We delve into Homer\u2019s epic accounts of the Trojan War and its aftermath. We see the epic transformed by the Roman poet Virgil, and the metamorphosis of the epic into an individual drama of salvation in Dante. We read tragedies by Euripides where individuals engineer disasters from which no recovery is possible, and we discuss Plato's quest for the ideal education, ideal love, and the ideal society. In political theory, we read Aristotle's analysis of political communities and the good life, and Marsilius of Padua\u2019s medieval treatise on the direct descent of political power from God to human beings. In history, we not only read Thucydides' tragic history of the fate of the Athenians in the Peloponnesian War, we also encounter the Enlightenment ideal of writing scientific history and those who question whether that is possible or even desirable. We look at the cityscapes of Alexander\u2019s empire, and we see how they became the model for Rome and its imitators. We read the first autobiography, written by St. Augustine in the fourth century, and the first Christian theory of history, which is also by Augustine. Throughout the course, we ask questions about the uniqueness of Western man's continuing fascination with the life of the mind and reason, and we think about why the idea of the alienated individual develops as it does in the West. In the process, we make connections between long-vanished worlds and our time. Grades are based on a series of essays, as students discuss and write their way to knowledge."

We begin with phenomenon of self-fashioning, not only in characters like Marlowe\u2019s Dr. Faustus, who barters his soul for knowledge, or Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet, who finds himself imprisoned in the private spaces of his mind, but with self-fashioning in religion with the Reformations of the sixteenth century and in revolutionary changes in the visual arts and architecture. Readings from Montaigne, Galileo, and others point the way toward a subjectively constituted, demystified world. Topics include the emergence of secular philosophy in Descartes and Locke; the origins of modern theories of the social contract in Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau; and Romanticism, with its emphasis on the world of feeling. We encounter the alienating world of industrial culture, and new theories about nature and history in Marx and Darwin. We examine Modernism in all its forms\u2014in psychology, in narrative, in the visual arts and architecture, in social planning, and in cinema. We also examine the impact of world wars, globalism, the newest versions of cultural imperialism, and the modern world's obsessions with self and self-revelation, and the attendant culture of celebrity. Readings include Rousseau, the English Romantics, Darwin, Marx, Kierkegaard, Baudelaire, Nietzsche, Freud, Thomas Mann, Heidegger, Virginia Woolf, and Samuel Beckett as well as contemporary writers as various as Patti Smith and Donna Tartt. Grades are based on a series of essays and on class participation. In WECS, we use the essay as a tool of thought as we write and discuss our way to knowledge."

Students will read from a variety of genres, times, and traditions and will explore forms of writing through modeling and experimentation. The guiding principle of the course is that creative writing is a means of exploration, discovery, and engagement with the world. The course is run as a workshop in which students collaborate in the creative process, giving each other constructive criticism and ideas for improvement. Assignments focus on developing the tools necessary for writing in many genres and styles, along with developing the habits to enable the generation of ideas, the creation of voice, the construction of narrative and image, and the process of revision. Throughout the term, students accumulate a group of works written in and out of class for inclusion in a portfolio that is the foundation of students' assessment in the course."

Dick, takes a new idea and makes it \u201cintellectually stimulating to the reader. . . . It unlocks the reader\u2019s mind so that that mind, like the author\u2019s, begins to create. Thus science fiction is creative and it inspires creativity.\u201d In this course, we will follow a series of writers and filmmakers as they attempt to unlock our minds and open them to the potentialities and problems of artificial general intelligence. As scientists around the world work to enhance machine learning capabilities and as figures ranging from Elon Musk to Henry Kissinger warn of the dangers of AI, this course will look to science fiction as a laboratory of ideas, one in which creative minds ask us to consider a number of different ways that AI is and could transform our society. Students will thus be asked, and generate their own answers to, a variety of questions that will accompany the development of general intelligence. Such questions include: How will researchers know when they have actually created a general intelligence? Will it be sentient? If so, what rules and laws should govern our treatment of AI, or AI\u2019s treatment of humanity? What\u2019s the difference between a human and algorithm trained to perfectly mimic that human\u2019s speech patterns? Can AI make art? And do androids dream of electric sheep? In this class, we will explore the answers our most imaginative artists have come up with to those questions."

These readings will allow us to think about how changing perceptions of the self, history, truth, women, sexuality, politics, social existence, and the natural world are registered in artworks spanning from the Renaissance to the twentieth century. Our course begins with an emphasis on Shakespeare\u2019s major comedies and tragedies, and from here we consider how Shakespeare\u2019s innovative approach for representing human nature was adapted and transformed by the artists who succeeded him. We pay special attention throughout the course to selected historical and social developments throughout British history and how they influenced (and were influenced by) the arts: the development of Renaissance humanism, the rise of Enlightenment rationalism, and the transformation of Britain into a modern, industrialized nation are a few of the trends that we study in parallel with the arts."

For nearly three thousand years, these stories of gods and mortals have gripped the imaginations of listeners and readers. In this course, we explore major myths of the ancient Greeks and Romans, with a special emphasis on how these oral tales were committed to writing in epic poems and tragic plays. Throughout the course, we seek to understand these myths in the geographical, historical, and cultural contexts in which they were created. We read ancient Greek and Roman texts in English translation, including works by Homer, Hesiod, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Vergil, and Ovid. Ancient works of art and architecture, including vase paintings and sculpture, form a rich complement to these written sources. We also explore major theories of myth interpretation\u2014from approaches taken by the ancient Greeks themselves to those developed by modern-day theorists\u2014and apply these theories to the myths we encounter. Finally, we explore how later artists, writers, and filmmakers have appropriated, interpreted, and transformed these ancient stories into new forms\u2014often for very different purposes than those served by the myths in the ancient world. Although most of the assessments are essay-based, we also take these ancient myths into our own imaginations in a deep and powerful way and transform them into our own original creations\u2014poems, narratives, dramatic scenes, visual art, and other forms. Our journey together culminates in a public performance of these metamorphoses."

        "description": "This course explores twentieth-century philosophy, literature, the visual arts, and the thematic ties that bind them together. After the mid-1840s, in both texts and images, painters, literary artists, and philosophers increasingly present the self as inherently unstable, reality as a construction, history as a fiction, and the universe as random and chaotic. We read Kierkegaard, who believed that escape from despair lay in taking a \u201cleap\u201d into an \u201cabsolute beginning,\u201d and Nietzsche, who embraced an ecstatic vision of the self as a product of will and desire. Heidegger, Sartre, Althusser, Baudrillard, and Deleuze provide other perspectives on the self as a freely constructed project. In painting, we trace the retreat from the Real in artists like Picasso and Matisse, and the longing to reveal the extraordinary in the ordinary in Magritte\u2014a desire that is pervasive in the novels of Virginia Woolf. Literary texts may include Emily Bront\u00eb's Wuthering Heights, Paul Bowles's The Sheltering Sky, Marguerite Duras' Hiroshima Mon Amour, Milan Kundera's The Unbearable Lightness of Being, and Samuel Beckett's Company, along with readings in Sartre, Woolf, Dostoevsky, Thomas Mann, Gertrude Stein, and Donna Tartt. Films include Ingmar Bergman's Kierkegaardian Winter Light and Woody Allen's Dostoevskian Crimes and Misdemeanors. Classes are conducted as seminars, with group discussions, background lectures, and presentations. Grades are based on a series of comparative essays and on class participation."

We'll turn many a page and roll film as we seek to more deeply understand these texts not only in their historical contexts but in light of modern adaptation and staging concerns for film and theater. Class discussion and substantial writing opportunities seek to bridge close analytical readings and broader contextual understandings of these plays in period, at present, and points between. Creative projects and presentations offer students the chance to learn in process and \u201csuffer the slings and arrows\u201d of rendering these works to engage an audience.

In this page-to-stage course, we examine how theatrical art wrestles with the implications and repercussions of STEM discoveries to explore larger questions of our humanity, purpose, and meaning. In addition to plays that include Life of Galileo, Copenhagen, and Arcadia, we consider a range of historical, literary, and scholarly texts that inform and contextualize these works. Through close reading, we strengthen our communication skills by analyzing and critiquing the way an author orients a lay audience to complex STEM concepts and connects them to larger thematic ideas. In a broader sense, our chief concern is to investigate how the efforts of science, mathematics, and the humanities to explain our world intersect, inform, and challenge one another\u2014how in mapping the stars, we might also map our hearts and minds. Creative, stage-related projects and formal academic writing assignments provide substantial opportunities for students to experiment with their own ideas and demonstrate their learning throughout the course."

In Latin America, literature and politics are hardly strangers; we will particularly examine the influence and representations of one political event\u2014the Chilean coup d\u2019etat in 1973, which was experienced firsthand by Ariel Dorfman and Roberto Bola\u00f1o, writers whose accounts of the event we will compare. Students will read, research, and write about contemporary authors such as Valeria Luiselli and C\u00e9sar Aira, and we will debate the usefulness of terms associated with Modern Latin American literature (e.g. \u201cmagical realism\u201d). Much of the literature we read in this class is highly original and experimental, sometimes wildly so. Developing the skills and confidence required to read, think about, discuss, and make sense of complex and rich texts are central concerns of this class."

        "description": "This course seeks to create a genealogy of the American West through the historical study of selected nineteenth-century American literary and visual texts. The selection is at once the problem and the occasion of our study, for even as these narratives and images give us the landscape, plots, and characters of a familiar \u201cwest,\u201d so they occlude a more comprehensive and diverse historical, cultural, and social terrain. In this course, we shall be as interested in the latter as in the former, seeking both to understand the construction of an American West and to discover territories of difference in the counter-narratives of places and peoples otherwise relegated to the margins of national myth. Our texts include novels, popular fiction such as storybook publications and dime novels, short stories, paintings, photography, histories, treaties, and political and legal writing."

In this course, students read, analyze, and discuss in French short stories, plays, poetry, and essays in conjunction with study of the fine arts, film, TV, and advertising to gain a deeper understanding of modern French and francophone cultures. Through the study of different media, students examine popular currents such as symbolism, surrealism, and existentialism that have shaped modern thought and philosophy. Previously-studied grammatical structures are reviewed, and more advanced grammar is introduced organically as it appears in the readings. Students sharpen all four language skills: listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Independent projects allow students to pursue personal interests, and class activities are enriched by visits to local museums, theater productions, and film screenings, depending on available exhibitions and shows."

        "description": "Another important aspect of French is its major influence on modernist and post-modernist thought, literature, and art. In this course, students read, analyze, and discuss in French short stories, plays, poetry, and essays in conjunction with study of the fine arts, film, TV, and advertising to gain a deeper understanding of modern French and francophone cultures. Through the study of different media, students examine popular currents such as symbolism, surrealism, and existentialism that have shaped modern thought and philosophy. Previously-studied grammatical structures are reviewed, and more advanced grammar is introduced organically as it appears in the readings. Students sharpen all four language skills: listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Independent projects allow students to pursue personal interests, and class activities are enriched by visits to local museums, theater productions, and film screenings, depending on available exhibitions and shows."

Immigration patterns and policy play key roles in these experiences, However, the United States has a fraught relationship with its own immigration history and remains divided about immigration policy. In this course, we examine 20th and 21st-century public policy and how political decisions affect and reflect the realities faced by immigrants, particularly immigrants from Asia, Africa, and Central and South America. In addition, by reading fiction by authors including Chimamanda Adichie, Fae Myenne Ng, Yuri Herrera, Valeria Luiselli, and Neel Patei, we examine how stories tell personal as well as political truths about the immigrant experience. By collecting oral histories from friends, family, and community members, students will contribute to current scholarship on immigration and will create work that can be contributed to the University of Minnesota immigration archive."

The class will collectively create a working list of characteristics that we can apply to legal cases, literature, and other mainstream pop-cultural texts such as plays, music (videos), TV shows, and movies. CRT provides a meaningful, practical, and evidence-based lens to engage in cultural productions of citizenship and race as they relate to the U.S. and to emerging concepts of global citizenship. One of the most important aspects of engaged citizenship is to formulate an understanding of the diverse experiences of U.S. citizens; this course allows students to explore those diverse experiences and different understandings of belonging through legal studies and storytelling/narratives. By the end of the course, students will produce scholarship that addresses their expanded knowledge base by applying the framework to a cultural text outside the required course texts."

        "description": "This course will introduce students to the major ethical topics and problems facing researchers and policymakers in the development and social integration of artificial intelligence. Because the class does not require any previous coursework in ethics, it will begin with a unit introducing students to the field of ethics and the techniques and terms of ethical reasoning. Students will read foundational texts in the three major fields of ethics\u2014virtue ethics, rules-based ethics, and consequentialist ethics\u2014as well as pragmatist and evolutionary challenges to those fields. This unit will conclude with an essay in which students choose one of the thinkers or schools of ethics that we have studied and argue for its usefulness in the programming of AI. After students have completed their introduction to ethical decision-making, the course will shift to project-based, student-driven learning, in which each student chooses one area of current AI research (i.e. self-driving cars, lethal autonomous weapons, facial recognition software, etc.) and explores the ethical ramifications of that research. Students will first assess the state of the field and its ethical challenges in a literature review, then generate a presentation for researchers and policy makers outlining those challenges and proposed solutions, and conclude with a position paper that argues for a specific legal or regulatory policy to govern the ethical rules of their chosen field."

The camera is much more than a recording apparatus; it is a medium via which messages reach us from another world that is not ours and that brings us to the heart of a great secret. Here magic begins.\u201d In a culture that increasingly relies on visual information, a comprehension of how meaning grows out of the moving image is essential. This course is a historical and critical survey of the motion picture both as a developing art form and as a medium of mass communication. The course entails systematic analysis of how filmmakers use sound and image to tell stories on the screen. Students view selected films as case studies to understand the relationship between theory and practice in filmmaking. Through explorations of the historical, social, and political dimensions of filmmaking, students learn to read and write more effectively, to look at the world with a critical eye, and most importantly, to develop a critical audio-visual literacy. Students demonstrate what they have learned through analytical writing assignments. The course may also include individual or group projects, presentations, creative writing, or short exercises in filmmaking."

Immigration patterns and policy play key roles in these experiences. However, the United States has a fraught relationship with its own immigration history and remains divided about immigration policy. In this course, we examine twentieth- and twenty-first-century public policy and how political decisions affect and reflect the realities faced by immigrants, particularly immigrants from Asia, Africa, and Central and South America. In addition, by reading fiction by authors including Chimamanda Adichie, Junot Diaz, Fae Myenne Ng, and Jhumpa Lahiri, we examine how stories tell personal as well as political truths about the immigrant experience. By collecting oral histories from friends, family, and community members, students will contribute to current scholarship on immigration and will create work that can be contributed to the University of Minnesota immigration archives."

        "description": "In critically examining our own minds we will distinguish several basic mental activities. Most basic is INTUITING as looking at or beholding any sensate thing, and even as contemplating mathematical truths or meaning expressed in images or symbols. SUFFERING is also a basic mental activity, as a being subjected to wide ranges of experience and feeling, as presupposed for knowing how another is feeling and even for recognizing and responding to irony and jokes. DREAMING is meaningful lived experience while sleeping, AESTHETIC SENSE is perception of beauty, and ETHICAL AWARENESS is perception of \u201cought\u201d as \u201cnot is,\u201d as presupposing some degree of freedom. Earliest in life is APPERCEPTION as an infant\u2019s experience of being looked at, by mother, as a continuity of being. Even EXPERIENCING NONSENSE may be creative. THINKING is grasping a manifold into a concept; JUDGING is joining concepts into a statement; REASONING is putting statements together logically; AI as computer logic depends on and expresses these three mental acts. In this course, we will read and discuss original texts describing mind: Plato on recollection; Aristotle on cause; Augustine on time; Anselm on belief; Descartes and Leibniz on thinking; Kant and Husserl on intending awareness; Winnicott on apperception; Mme de Condorcet and Mme de Lambert on feeling.

Even in today's modern, ostensibly secular world, religion continues to exercise a powerful role in the lives and relationships of individuals, communities, and societies. Religious literacy is more important than ever in an increasingly globalized age, and for the promotion of peaceable world. In this course, using a variable selection of topics, we investigate the phenomenon of religion as a human activity, taking a comparative approach to examine several of the world's major religious traditions, as well as a number of practices that don't usually count as \"religious.\" Through the exploration of key topics, we ask a variety of questions about religion, including: What is religion? What commonalities do religions have, and how do they differ\u2014internally and externally? How do religions attempt to address the major problems of human life? What visions of the true, the beautiful, and the good do various religions offer? How do religious adherents and discontents seek to shape their individual and social lives in response to religion? What is the relationship of religion and the modern world, especially regarding secularity and science? To answer these questions, we investigate myth and ritual theory, textual and oral traditions, religious thought and dissent, ethics and identity formation, aesthetics and practices, and more. We also take our exploration out of the classroom, conducting field work to experience religion as it is lived."

With time for deeper examination of contemporary American life, the course familiarizes students with the context of continuing political, social, and cultural issues and with the arcs of recent change relevant to their own lifetimes. By studying selected primary and secondary sources from the 1960s to the present day, students construct their own understandings of the multiple identities articulated by modern Americans living in increasingly global and virtual communities. The course offers students the opportunity to explore topics of consequence to them, including explorations of the effects of 9/11, the rise of the LGBTQ movement, and the changes wrought on American culture by the internet and mobile computing. Students cultivate skills of analysis that help them to think and speak with greater clarity, power, and eloquence. Assessments include writing assignments that invite students to synthesize their understanding of the texts, contexts, and cultural artifacts explored in the course."

Topics include: work and labor; sexuality and sexual identity; gender relations; images of women and gender in literature, science and technology, religion, and art; family structures and domestic roles; and the history of feminist struggles. Course readings are drawn from the humanities and the social sciences. We will use discussion, lecture, film, reading, written texts, and popular culture to help students continue to develop their skills in reading, critical thinking, writing, presenting, and working collaboratively with their peers to answer questions such as: How do the experiences of women and other subordinated groups help us to understand gender norms, identity categories, and sexuality? How might one perform, analyze, interrogate, and challenge what has been constructed as \u201cnormal\u201d in contemporary western culture? This class explores a multitude of feminist perspectives on the intersections of gender, race, sexuality, class, physical ability, nationality, age and other categories of identity. Students will interrogate these categories as socially-constructed while acknowledging that these constructions have real effects in subordinating groups, marking bodies and creating structural, intersectional inequalities."

Nouns and verbs get the most attention, with pronouns, adjectives, and adverbs relating to them. But prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections are short and spare.

The simple grammar in the book's beginning becomes more complex as the fighting increases; rhetorical devices of style are evident. This true story of human suffering arouses compassion and fear, as Aristotle said tragic accounts must do in educating and transforming their audience, and comparison is made with current events. This course ends with a study of parts of Caesar\u2019s De Bello Gallico, book 4, 1-33, in which Caesar states that his lack of knowledge about Britannia spurs him to invade its coast, though it turns out afterwards that, as he wrote about himself, \u201cThis one thing was lacking to his pristine fortune.\""

If you are planning to pursue a career as a computer programmer, software engineer, data scientist, security analyst, or financial analyst then discrete mathematics is for you! The mathematics of modern computer science is built almost entirely on discrete math, such as logic, combinatorics, proof, and graph theory. Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are countable or otherwise distinct and separable. Discrete math is very much \u201creal world\u201d mathematics. The somewhat abstract nature of these subjects often turns off students. By contrast, discrete math, in particular counting and probability, allows students to very quickly explore non-trivial \u201creal world\u201d problems that are challenging and interesting. At most universities, an undergraduate-level course in discrete mathematics is required for students who are interested in these fields. This course will prepare students for college level algebra, statistics, and discrete mathematics courses. This course is aligned to the new NCDPI course in Discrete Mathematics. The purpose of this course is to introduce discrete structures that are the backbone of computer science.",

Students then write a detailed research proposal and defend it to a panel of their peers. If time permits, students begin to learn techniques and to gather data for their experiments. Throughout the term, students read from the primary scientific literature and participate in discussion groups on current issues in physics research. Based on the outcomes of the term's work, students may be given an opportunity to participate in summer research programs on campus. Students with a final grade of B or higher are expected to continue in PH446 Research in Physics III during fall semester of their senior year."

Lessons on the college selection process help students to identify types of colleges and universities, to understand how elements of a college or university may impact their educational experience, and to learn how to find colleges and universities that are a good fit for them. Lessons focused on the college application process are designed to help students understand deadlines and terms associated with the college application process, to connect students to resources to reduce costs, and to provide students an opportunity to gain experience developing applications and essays. Campus life lessons focus on the total cost of attending a college or university, programs on college campuses such as study abroad and living learning communities, and transitioning from the NCSSM experience to their unique college or university experience",

The course will involve nightly reading assignments, critical thinking questions, vocabulary development, labs, projects and research investigations and experiments. In addition, there will be frequent reading quizzes and unit exams involving both multiple choice and free-response components. The course will cover those topics generally discussed in a college level introductory psychology course. These topics include: social psychology, history, careers, theories, research methods, biological bases of behavior, sensation/perception, consciousness, learning, memory, cognition, development, personality, stress, disorders and treatments. Students will learn about the methods and ethical approaches of professional Psychology."

City-state interactions in ancient Greece resemble dynamics of great power relations today, such as those between the United States and China. However, we also find that new technologies (nuclear and cyber weapons,) shared threats (climate change and terrorism,) and the spread of liberal democracy alter these interactions in sometimes counterintuitive ways. International Relations (IR) introduces the formal study of how countries interrelate, focusing on the broad subject areas of international security and economics. In this course, we learn about the primary actors, their various instruments, and patterns of interactions. Students acquire a conceptual toolbox for framing international issues and events and analyzing their causes and consequences. The course challenges students to critically assess the philosophical and ideological underpinnings of major IR schools of thought. Course activities include a group project investigating a contemporary conflict, the application of IR theory to current events, a documentary viewing, and regular discussion of international news."

Often, the theoretical and methodological basis for the assertions in our readings may appear to be \u201ccommon sense,\u201d but through a detailed examination, we find that this is not the case. According to Berger, \"The first wisdom of sociology is this\u2014things are not what they seem. This, too, is a deceptively simple statement. It ceases to be simple after a while. Social reality turns out to have many layers.\u201d We explore the forces that influence us and thus examine our conception of the world around us: the taken-for-granted reality and all its implications."

We explore a range of issues, concerns, and specialties in psychology. Initially, we spend a considerable amount of time discussing the psychological perspective and the role of theory and research in psychology. Then we move into an in-depth study of key components of psychology. We learn about some of the explorations and discoveries made by psychologists over the past century, and we compare, contrast, and assess some of the differing approaches adopted by psychologists, including biological, behavioral, cognitive, humanistic, psychodynamic, and sociocultural perspectives. Most importantly, we come to an understanding and appreciation of how psychologists think and the kind of critical analyses of human behavior that psychologists espouse and model in their words and actions. This course prepares students for the AP Psychology exam."
