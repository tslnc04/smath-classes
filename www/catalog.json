        "description": "Drawing is the foundation of all art studio practices and is highly recommended as a prerequisite for all other art courses. A creative mind is increasingly sought out in every professional career track as art elements and design concepts are interdisciplinary. This course is taught to nurture creative and critical thinking, increase visual communication skills, and reacquaint the student with the \"artist within.\" No experience is necessary! All students receive individual feedback from the instructor and further engage with classmates during studio time and the critiquing process. Through traditional drawing exercises with pencil, charcoal, and ink, students gain creative applications to better interpret reality and respond to their aesthetic values. In addition to in-class drawing assignments, all students are given a sketchbook to heighten their observation skills while building a visual vocabulary and further documenting their time at NCSSM.

In this course, we explore and apply the research process in the creation of fine art. Through careful study of a selected genre or discipline and rigorous interrogation of a subject or set of subjects, we explore the intersections between fact and invention, the difficulty of separating the objective from the subjective, and the ethical implications of using research to inform the creation of art. The culmination of the course is student-created works of art informed by the research process. The area of the fine arts on which the course focuses varies year to year and encompass the range of the fine arts \u2013 from creative writing to the visual arts, music, and drama.

The guiding principle of the course is that creative writing is a means of engaging with the world, whether that means writing a personal essay, a food memoir, or a sonnet. In addition to one synchronous class each week, students will work individually on asynchronous assignments and collaborate with peers in workshops where burgeoning writers encounter an affirming and constructive audience for their work. Assignments focus on developing the tools for writing in many genres and styles, along with developing the habits to enable the generation of ideas, the creation of voice, the construction of narrative and image, and the process of revision. Throughout the term, students accumulate a group of works written in and out of class for inclusion in a portfolio that is the foundation of students\u2019 assessment in the course.

        "description": "This interdisciplinary course begins with the Ming dynasty in China and the Ashikaga Shogunate in Japan. A major focus of this course is the experience of East Asian societies as they confront internal challenges and Western colonizers. Primary texts include readings about Noh theater and chado, Basho's poetry, Journey to the West and Dream of the Red Chamber. The second part of the course presents a radically changed and dynamic landscape. We explore the upheavals of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, including the world wars and revolutionary restructuring of East Asian politics and societies. We explore the significance of modernism and postmodernism in contemporary Asian cultural expressions. Texts may include Kawabata's Snow Country or Tanizaki's Naomi, manga and anime, writings of Mao Zedong, CCP propaganda posters, kung fu and samurai film clips, and Zhang Yimou\u2019s To Live. The class consists of a creative mix of lectures, discussions, and verbal and written analyses of moving and still images. Students continue to develop their writing skills by writing academic and interpretive essays on interdisciplinary topics as well as creative works that emulate East Asian genres. Students also collaborate on projects where they produce their own artwork (such as kung fu and samurai film scripts reflecting East Asian geopolitical realities, visual depictions of futuristic dystopias drawing from techno-Orientalist stereotypes, etc.) to demonstrate their understanding of East Asian cultures and accomplishments.",

Readings may include excerpts from Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War, Sima Qian's Records of the Historian, Sun Tzu's Art of War, Confucius' Analects, Laozi's Dao de Jing, memorials by Han Feizi and Li Si, the Bible, Buddhist sutras, Homer's Iliad, Luo Guanzhong's Three Kingdoms, St. Augustine's City of God, collected writings of the Church fathers, Castiglione's Book of the Courtier, Sei Shonagon's Pillow Book, and Murasaki Shikibu's Tale of Genji. Secondary texts and film clips will also be used to interpret these ancient and classical works. Students reflect on the intellectual frameworks and ethical foundations of East Asia and the West and analyze the evolution and manifestations of these ideas and values in cultural products, institutions, rituals, and ceremonies.

We investigate the complex world view that produced innovations in cartography and navigation in Europe, as well as the religious and social motivations of Iberian explorers and how their attitudes differed from their English and French counterparts. We look at the blended culture of the Caribbean and at the nature of slave culture in Brazil and the Caribbean, along with constructions of color and understandings of race that differ markedly from those in North America.

Students examine topics such as the devastating effects of the Cold War/Proxy wars in Latin America, the development of different cultures throughout the region, environmental concerns and crises affecting the resources and environment of Central and South America, the influx of Hispanic immigrants into North America, the development of Latino identity, the impact of the drug wars on all parts of the Americas, and new roles for Latin Americans in the twenty-first century.

        "description": "This course begins with the idea of the individual as it emerges in the literature, philosophy, religion, and art of Ancient Greece, Rome, and Late Antiquity. It continues with ideas about identity in medieval Christendom, and traces the emergence of national literatures, new forms of architecture, the first nation-states in the High Middle Ages, and the admiration for the classics in Dante\u2019s Inferno and in Petrarch, the poet whose preoccupation with his own celebrity points the way to the humanism of the Renaissance and the concept of self-fashioning that is the hallmark of modernity. Our course ends with the rebirth of portraiture, with Machiavelli and the rebirth of secular history, and the idea that the self, history, and even the individual\u2019s relationship to God can be fashioned by newly empowered individuals. We see the Greeks invent history as an entity distinct from both myth and chronicle, and learn how ideas about history evolved along with ideas about the self, that mysterious and vexing entity that is still our preoccupation today. Throughout the term, we read forward and backward in the Western tradition, exploring both contemporary and earlier debates about the nature of history, personal identity, and the uses of literature and art, not only in ancient medieval, and Renaissance writers, but in modern thinkers from Marx to Nietzsche, Adorno, Althusser, and Deleuze. We delve into Homer\u2019s epic accounts of the Trojan War and its aftermath. We see the epic transformed by the Roman poet Virgil, and the metamorphosis of the epic into an individual drama of salvation in Dante. We read tragedies by Euripides and Shakespeare\u2019s contemporary, Christopher Marlowe, in which individuals engineer disasters from which no recovery is possible, and we discuss Plato's quest for the ideal education, ideal love, and the ideal society. In political theory, we read Aristotle's analysis of political communities and the good life, and Marsilius of Padua\u2019s medieval treatise on the direct descent of political power from God to human beings. In history, we not only read Thucydides' tragic history of how the Athenians laid the ground for losing the democracy they had invented. We also encounter the Enlightenment ideal of a scientific history and those who question whether such a history is even desirable. We look at the cityscapes of Alexander\u2019s empire, and we see how they became the model for Rome and its imitators. We read the first autobiography, written by St. Augustine in the fourth century, and the first Christian theory of history, which is also by Augustine. Throughout the course, we ask questions about the uniqueness of Western man's continuing fascination with the life of the mind and reason, and we think about why the idea of the alienated individual develops as it does in the West. In the process, we make connections between long-vanished worlds and our time. Grades are based on a series of essays, as students discuss and write their way to knowledge.",

We begin with phenomenon of self-fashioning, not only in characters like Marlowe\u2019s Dr. Faustus, who barters his soul for knowledge, or Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet, who finds himself imprisoned in the private spaces of his mind, but with self-fashioning in religion with the Reformations of the sixteenth century and in revolutionary changes in the visual arts and architecture. Readings from Montaigne, Galileo, and others point the way toward a subjectively constituted, demystified world. Topics include the emergence of secular philosophy in Descartes and Locke; the origins of modern theories of the social contract in Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau; and Romanticism, with its emphasis on the world of feeling. We encounter the alienating world of industrial culture, and new theories about nature and history in Marx and Darwin. We examine Modernism in all its forms\u2014in psychology, in narrative, in the visual arts and architecture, in social planning, and in cinema. We also examine the impact of world wars, globalism, the newest versions of cultural imperialism, and the modern world's obsessions with self and self-revelation, and the attendant culture of celebrity. Readings include Rousseau, the English Romantics, Darwin, Marx, Kierkegaard, Baudelaire, Nietzsche, Freud, Thomas Mann, Heidegger, Virginia Woolf, and Samuel Beckett as well as contemporary writers as various as Patti Smith and Donna Tartt. Grades are based on a series of essays and on class participation. In WECS, we use the essay as a tool of thought as we write and discuss our way to knowledge.",

Thus science fiction is creative and it inspires creativity.\u201d In this course, we will follow a series of writers and filmmakers as they attempt to unlock our minds and open them to the potentialities and problems of artificial general intelligence. As scientists around the world work to enhance machine learning capabilities and as figures ranging from Elon Musk to Henry Kissinger warn of the dangers of AI, this course will look to science fiction as a laboratory of ideas, one in which creative minds ask us to consider a number of different ways that AI is and could transform our society. Students will thus be asked, and generate their own answers to, a variety of questions that will accompany the development of general intelligence. Such questions include: How will researchers know when they have actually created a general intelligence? Will it be sentient? If so, what rules and laws should govern our treatment of AI, or AI\u2019s treatment of humanity? What\u2019s the difference between a human and algorithm trained to perfectly mimic that human\u2019s speech patterns? Can AI make art? And do androids dream of electric sheep?

For nearly three thousand years, these stories of gods and mortals have gripped the imaginations of listeners and readers. In this course, we explore major myths of the ancient Greeks and Romans, with a special emphasis on how these oral tales were committed to writing in epic poems and tragic plays. Throughout the course, we seek to understand these myths in the geographical, historical, and cultural contexts in which they were created. We read ancient Greek and Roman texts in English translation, including works by Homer, Hesiod, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Vergil, and Ovid. Ancient works of art and architecture, including vase paintings and sculpture, form a rich complement to these written sources. We also explore major theories of myth interpretation\u2014from approaches taken by the ancient Greeks themselves to those developed by modern-day theorists\u2014and apply these theories to the myths we encounter. Finally, we explore how later artists, writers, and filmmakers have appropriated, interpreted, and transformed these ancient stories into new forms\u2014often for very different purposes than those served by the myths in the ancient world. Although most of the assessments are essay-based, we also take these ancient myths into our own imaginations in a deep and powerful way and transform them into our own original creations\u2014poems, narratives, dramatic scenes, visual art, and other forms. Our journey together culminates in a public performance of these metamorphoses.",

Readings may include short stories by Jorge Luis Borges and Michel Tournier; novels such as Conrad's Heart of Darkness, Bram Stoker's Dracula, Osamu Dazai's No Longer Human, Milan Kundera's The Unbearable Lightness of Being, Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury, Alejo Carpentier's The Kingdom of This World, Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, Miguel de Unamuno's San Manuel Bueno, M\u00e1rtir, Kafka's Metamorphosis, Gide's The Immoralist, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude, and Donna Tartt's Secret History. Through a series of analytical essays, students explore questions about authors and their audiences and the relationship between literary texts and contexts. In the process, students strengthen their own voices and explore the connections between literary and cultural identity.",

        "description": "This course explores twentieth-century philosophy, literature, the visual arts, and the thematic ties that bind them together. After the mid-1840s, in both texts and images, painters, literary artists, and philosophers increasingly present the self as inherently unstable, reality as a construction, history as a fiction, and the universe as random and chaotic. We read Kierkegaard, who believed that escape from despair lay in taking a \u201cleap\u201d into an \u201cabsolute beginning,\u201d and Nietzsche, who embraced an ecstatic vision of the self as a product of will and desire. Heidegger, Sartre, Althusser, Baudrillard, and Deleuze provide other perspectives on the self as a freely constructed project. In painting, we trace the retreat from the Real in artists like Picasso and Matisse, and the longing to reveal the extraordinary in the ordinary in Magritte\u2014a desire that is pervasive in the novels of Virginia Woolf. Literary texts may include Emily Bront\u00eb's Wuthering Heights, Paul Bowles's The Sheltering Sky, Marguerite Duras' Hiroshima Mon Amour, Milan Kundera's The Unbearable Lightness of Being, and Samuel Beckett's Company, along with readings in Sartre, Woolf, Dostoevsky, Thomas Mann, Gertrude Stein, and Donna Tartt. Films include Ingmar Bergman's Kierkegaardian Winter Light and Woody Allen's Dostoevskian Crimes and Misdemeanors. Classes are conducted as seminars, with group discussions, background lectures, and presentations. Grades are based on a series of comparative essays and on class participation.",

We'll turn many a page and roll film as we seek to more deeply understand these texts not only in their historical contexts but in light of modern adaptation and staging concerns for film and theater. Class discussion and substantial writing opportunities seek to bridge close analytical readings and broader contextual understandings of these plays in period, at present, and points between.

On our way to understanding what it is that makes a work \u201cSouthern\u201d besides a map and a birth certificate, we investigate an array of aspects of Southern literature and culture, both \u201chigh culture\u201d and \u201clow culture.\u201d Through a combination of study of the work of major Southern novelists, short-story writers, and poets (e.g., William Faulkner, Flannery O\u2019Connor, Alice Walker, Natasha Trethewey, Walker Percy, Allen Tate, Robert Penn Warren, Cormac McCarthy), as well as key cultural features that are taken to be crucial to the South (including memory, food, music, and religion), we discuss the ways place, race, class, gender, and sexuality refract our ideas of what it means for a person or a work to be \u201cSouthern.\u201d We also address the questions of whether and how \u201cthe South\u201d continues to be, if it ever was, a useful or coherent concept\u2014particularly regarding claims of uniqueness.",

In this page-to-stage course, we examine how theatrical art wrestles with the implications and repercussions of STEM discoveries to explore larger questions of our humanity, purpose, and meaning. In addition to plays that include Life of Galileo, Copenhagen, and Arcadia, we consider a range of historical, literary, and scholarly texts that inform and contextualize these works. Through close reading, we strengthen our communication skills by analyzing and critiquing the way an author orients a lay audience to complex STEM concepts and connects them to larger thematic ideas. In a broader sense, our chief concern is to investigate how the efforts of science, mathematics, and the humanities to explain our world intersect, inform, and challenge one another\u2014how in mapping the stars, we might also map our hearts and minds. Creative, stage-related projects and formal academic writing assignments provide substantial opportunities for students to experiment with their own ideas and demonstrate their learning throughout the course.",

In Latin America, literature and politics are hardly strangers; we will particularly examine the influence and representations of one political event\u2014the Chilean coup d\u2019etat in 1973, which was experienced firsthand by Ariel Dorfman and Roberto Bola\u00f1o, writers whose accounts of the event we will compare. Students will read, research, and write about contemporary authors such as Valeria Luiselli and C\u00e9sar Aira, and we will debate the usefulness of terms associated with Modern Latin American literature (e.g. \u201cmagical realism\u201d).

This course is necessarily interdisciplinary, because it is, among other things, a critique of the division of labor within institutions of knowledge. In other words, even as it seeks to understand how disciplines such as anthropology, psychology, sociology, political science, economics, and literature constitute their objects of study (the human, the mind, society, etc.), it also attends carefully to the limits of disciplinary formation, to the ways in which the \u201chuman\u201d or \u201cnature\u201d escape the classificatory systems within which they are defined and to which they are confined. Research in Humanities is organized around theories and practices of research in the humanities and the sciences. The study of theory is necessary because these researches should be critical and historical, interrogating both their subject\u2019s conditions of possibility and the contemporary situation of their study.  Each week, members of the seminar will consider different theoretical approaches to reading and writing about diverse texts. These approaches include, but are not limited to, political criticism, cultural and ethnic studies, feminism, gender and sexuality, historicism, and colonial and post-colonial critique. As for practice, students will learn how to conduct research and how to construct an effective thesis statement that will govern an argument developed and sustained throughout a paper of twenty- to twenty-five pages. The proper use of evidence, as well as considerations of evidentiary significance, will also be fundamental to the course\u2019s concerns. Students will then transform their research into articles for scholarly publication, including Fifth World, NCSSM\u2019s journal of interdisciplinary research in the humanities. They will serve on the editorial board for Fifth World, evaluating submissions, offering suggestions for revisions, and ensuring the timely delivery of the completed journal to the publisher.",

        "description": "In this course, the exploration into language continues but expands to encompass elements that reflect the breadth and depth of the francophone world: the primary focus is culture, history, society, and literature of various French-speaking peoples. Through a rich program of original short films, audio activities, cultural readings, authentic full length stories and plays, students improve their understanding of spoken French and further develop their speaking, reading, and writing skills. Classroom activities emphasize communication, allowing students to interact and apply what they are learning. An accompanying web-based program provides additional language exercises to reinforce and enhance grammatical structures learned in previous courses. Students will become familiar with most grammatical structures and will apply them in speaking and writing. The course content is theme-focused and speaks to current as well as perennial issues, such as race and gender, the role of science, technology and media, and environmental issues in francophone culture and society. These topics inform class discussions, skits, debates, oral presentations, and serve as the  basis for writing in French. Students will practice their writing skills in a variety of ways, including short blog entries, reflections, and analytical essays.",

Computational data analysis, topic modeling, GIS mapping, and data visualization give us more tools with which to explore the rich field of humanities, as we strive to understand what it means to be humans who read, write, interpret, and share texts. In Digital Humanities, students learn and apply a wide variety of computing methods (such as text pattern analyses, network generation and analyses, and image processing) and tools (such as Mathematica and R) to the study of literature, history, art, and other subjects in the humanities and social sciences. A main feature of the course is the opportunity for students to apply these methods and tools to explore their own interests and areas of inquiry in a culminating research project. Digital Humanities lies at the intersection of the study of the humanities\u2014literature and language, history, economics, psychology, sociology, and the arts\u2014with the technologies, techniques, and tools of computational science and is team-taught by instructors from the Humanities and Science Departments.",

This unit will conclude with an essay in which students choose one of the thinkers or schools of ethics that we have studied and argue for its usefulness in the programming of AI. After students have completed their introduction to ethical decision-making, the course will shift to project-based, student-driven learning, in which each student chooses one area of current AI research (i.e. self-driving cars, lethal autonomous weapons, facial recognition software, etc.) and explores the ethical ramifications of that research. Students will first assess the state of the field and its ethical challenges in a literature review, then generate a presentation for researchers and policy makers outlining those challenges and proposed solutions, and conclude with a position paper that argues for a specific legal or regulatory policy to govern the ethical rules of their chosen field.",

This course is a historical and critical survey of the motion picture both as a developing art form and as a medium of mass communication. The course entails systematic analysis of how filmmakers use sound and image to tell stories on the screen. Students view selected films as case studies to understand the relationship between theory and practice in filmmaking. Through explorations of the historical, social, and political dimensions of filmmaking, students learn to read and write more effectively, to look at the world with a critical eye, and most importantly, to develop a critical audio-visual literacy.

Immigration patterns and policy play key roles in these experiences. However, the United States has a fraught relationship with its own immigration history and remains divided about immigration policy. In this course, we examine twentieth- and  twenty-first-century public policy and how political decisions affect and reflect the realities faced by immigrants, particularly immigrants from Asia, Africa, and Central and South America. In addition, by reading fiction by authors including Chimamanda Adichie, Junot Diaz, Fae Myenne Ng, and Jhumpa Lahiri, we examine how stories tell personal as well as political truths about the immigrant experience. By collecting oral histories from friends, family, and community members, students will contribute to current scholarship on immigration and will create work that can be contributed to the University of Minnesota immigration archives.",

        "description": "In critically examining our own minds we will distinguish several basic mental activities. Most basic is INTUITING as looking at or beholding any sensate thing, and even as contemplating mathematical truths or meaning expressed in images or symbols. SUFFERING is also a basic mental activity, as a being subjected to wide ranges of experience and feeling, as presupposed for knowing how another is feeling and even for recognizing and responding to irony and jokes. DREAMING is meaningful lived experience while sleeping, AESTHETIC SENSE is perception of beauty, and ETHICAL AWARENESS is perception of \u201cought\u201d as \u201cnot is,\u201d as presupposing some degree of freedom. Earliest in life is APPERCEPTION as an infant\u2019s experience of being looked at, by mother, as a continuity of being. Even EXPERIENCING NONSENSE may be creative. THINKING is grasping a manifold into a concept; JUDGING is joining concepts into a statement; REASONING is putting statements together logically; AI as computer logic depends on and expresses these three mental acts. In this course, we will read and discuss original texts describing mind: Plato on recollection; Aristotle on cause; Augustine on time; Anselm on belief; Descartes and Leibniz on thinking; Kant and Husserl on intending awareness; Winnicott on apperception; Mme de Condorcet and Mme de Lambert on feeling.

Even in today's modern, ostensibly secular world, religion continues to exercise a powerful role in the lives and relationships of individuals, communities, and societies. Religious literacy is more important than ever in an increasingly globalized age, and for the promotion of peaceable world. In this course, using a variable selection of topics, we investigate the phenomenon of religion as a human activity, taking a comparative approach to examine several of the world's major religious traditions, as well as a number of practices that don't usually count as \"religious.\" Through the exploration of key topics, we ask a variety of questions about religion, including: What is religion? What commonalities do religions have, and how do they differ\u2014internally and externally? How do religions attempt to address the major problems of human life? What visions of the true, the beautiful, and the good do various religions offer? How do religious adherents and discontents seek to shape their individual and social lives in response to religion? What is the relationship of religion and the modern world, especially regarding secularity and science? To answer these questions, we investigate myth and ritual theory, textual and oral traditions, religious thought and dissent, ethics and identity formation, aesthetics and practices, and more. We also take our exploration out of the classroom, conducting field work to experience religion as it is lived.",

The course offers students the opportunity to explore topics of consequence to them, including explorations of the effects of 9/11, the rise of the LGBTQ movement, and the changes wrought on American culture by the internet and mobile computing.

How might one perform, analyze, interrogate, and challenge what has been constructed as \u201cnormal\u201d in contemporary western culture? This class explores a multitude of feminist perspectives on the intersections of gender, race, sexuality, class, physical ability, nationality, age and other categories of identity.

Being a data scientist requires an integrated skill set spanning mathematics, statistics, machine learning, databases and other branches of computer science along with a good understanding of the craft of problem\r\nformulation to engineer effective solutions. This course will introduce students to this rapidly growing field and equip them with some of its basic principles and tools as well as its general mindset. Students will learn concepts, techniques and tools they need to deal with various facets of data science practice, including data collection and integration, exploratory data analysis, predictive\r\nmodeling, descriptive modeling, data product creation, evaluation, and effective communication. The focus in the treatment of these topics will be on breadth, rather than depth, and emphasis will be placed on integration and synthesis of concepts and their application to solving problems. To make the learning contextual, real datasets from a variety of scientific disciplines will be used.",

The course will frequently consider international applications and scenarios while studying microeconomic topics related to income inequality, factor market dynamics, labor costs, and global entrepreneurship. Students pursue this topic through case studies or strategic problems involving pricing issues in product and factor markets, competition across various market structures, and industrial and social regulation within both historic and contemporary environments. Thus, the curriculum content and processes of analyses are organized around holistic, ill-structured real-world problems and case studies. These experiences are designed to be of an integrated and multi-layered nature and provide opportunities to discover and apply the microeconomics concepts from our readings and discussions. In taking this consciously constructivist approach, we integrate other disciplines into the study of microeconomics.

        "description": "This course is a continuation of SS4060 and offers students an opportunity for immersion in a fascinating discipline and in logical thinking. This immersive process involves an introduction to general economic theory and more specific microeconomic theory. Graphical analysis will play a major role in understanding the relationship between economic variables. The course will frequently consider international applications and scenarios while studying microeconomic topics related to income inequality, factor market dynamics, labor costs, and global entrepreneurship. Students pursue this topic through case studies or strategic problems involving pricing issues in product and factor markets, competition across various market structures, and industrial and social regulation within both historic and contemporary environments. Thus, the curriculum content and processes of analyses are organized around holistic, ill-structured real-world problems and case studies. These experiences are designed to be of an integrated and multi-layered nature and provide opportunities to discover and apply the microeconomics concepts from our readings and discussions. In taking this consciously constructivist approach, we integrate other disciplines into the study of microeconomics. Elements from the fields of psychology, history, political science, and mathematics all have roles to play as we propose resolutions to our microeconomic problems and case studies.",
