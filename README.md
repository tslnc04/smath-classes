# smath-classes

An unofficial course catalog for the [North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics](https://ncssm.edu) (NCSSM).

## What?

An alternative to the [current course catalog](https://uniapp.ncssm.edu/registrar/catalog/course_catalog_beta1.3.1.php) that the NCSSM registrar maintains. The website is implemented in pure HTML/CSS/JS, with no external dependencies and the scraping portion is written in Python3, only dependent on Beautiful Soup.

## Why?

Mobile support. The official version doesn't just look bad, it's borderline impossible to use on a mobile device.

Additionally, the official version does not allow editing of search queries, only resetting them. This becomes infuriating when one clicks the wrong option and is forced to redo the search.

Eventually, the faults of the official site bothered me enough to just recreate the site done properly.
